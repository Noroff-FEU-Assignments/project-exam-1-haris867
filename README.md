A travel blog made with pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript. With the posts stored in Wordpress, which is used as a headless CMS.

## Description

This site was created using pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript to demonstrate how much we'd learned about these languages.

It's a blog site designed by me, which is also responsive and WCAG-compliant.

I was tasked with creating a blog site which fetched posts stored on a WordPress installation used as a headless CMS, using the WordPress REST API.
